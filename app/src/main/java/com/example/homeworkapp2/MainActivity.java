//Main features of this app:
    //- Recycler view utilising an adapter in order to show 10 restaurants along with important details such as location, name, cuisine and rating.
    //- Images of restaurants displayed in both main and detail activity.
        //- Done through using if statements checking the restaurant name, and choosing the appropriate image to be displayed as a result.
        //- Done both in recycler view and detail activity.
    //- Detail activity opens when you click on the restaurant to display further details such as average cost.
        //- Utilises intent and Array List position (which is converted into a restaurant name) in order to get appropriate restaurant to be displayed in detail activity.
        //- Parts of the detail activity are set to the attributes of the appropriate restaurant.
        //- Utilising an interface and on click listener inside the adapter in order to switch pages
            //- Added an interface to the constructor of the adapter to allow for the click to register
            //- Interface instantiated from main activity with the interface referenced.
//- Main technical implementations include:
    //- intents
    //- recycler view and adapter
    //- resource image files
    //- Multiple different font implementations for better, cleaner and more consistent aesthetic.

//the interface in implemented by the main activity in order to use the interface in my adapter.
// This allows me to use the on click listener in the adapter in order to switch to the detail activity.
